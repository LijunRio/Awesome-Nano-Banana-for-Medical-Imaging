# ü§ù Contributing to Awesome Nano Banana for Medical Imaging

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! We welcome contributions that expand our collection of examples showcasing Nano Banana (Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image) capabilities in medical imaging.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Example Format Guidelines

All new examples must follow the established format used in the README.md. Each example should include:

#### Required Structure:
```markdown
### Example N: [Descriptive Title]

**Prompt**
<details>
<summary>Show prompt</summary>

```
[Your complete prompt here]
```
</details>

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| <img src="./images/[input_filename].png" alt="[Input description]" width="200"> | <img src="./images/[output_filename].png" alt="[Output description]" width="200"> |

[Data Resource]([source_url])
```

#### Key Requirements:
- **Descriptive Title**: Use clear, specific titles that describe the task (e.g., "Detection of abnormal regions in MRI slice")
- **Complete Prompt**: Include the full prompt used, even if lengthy
- **Image References**: Use relative paths (`./images/filename.png`) for images
- **Alt Text**: Provide meaningful alt text for accessibility
- **Data Source**: Always include the original data source URL

### 2. Data Source Attribution

**MANDATORY**: Every example must include proper attribution to the original data source.

- **LICENSE COMPLIANCE**: Strictly respect original licensing and usage terms

### 3. Image Guidelines

- **Storage**: Place images in the `images/` directory
- **AI-Generated Content**: Sample images may be generated using large language models (such as Nano Banana/Gemini), provided they are used solely for research and educational purposes
- **License Compliance**: All images must comply with applicable licenses and usage terms. Clearly indicate if images are AI-generated in the example description
